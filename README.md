Programming Project 1 â€“ Data Editing and Reduction
____________
Instructions:
Choose your preferred programming language (Python, R, Java, C, Perl, SQL, etc) and implement three
programs with the following requirements:
1. Assume that the training datasets are csv files comprised of numerical attributes only with the 
exception of the class attribute. You can also assume that the class attribute is the last attribute 
of the file.
2. Implement program NormalizeValues that takes as input a csv file and normalizes the values of
all its attributes (i.e., transforms them in the [0, 1] range). Obviously, the class attribute should 
be excluded. The normalized file should be written to disk.
3. Implement program ENN that takes as input a normalized csv file and applies the editing 
algorithm ENN on it. The edited file should be written to disk.
4. Implement program IB2 that takes as input a normalized csv file and applies the instance 
reduction algorithm IB2 on it. The reduced file should be written to disk.
5. Test your implementations with the provided iris.csv and letter-recognition.csv datasets.
Submit in a zip file with
(a) your code (for compiled languages like Java, C, etc., also submit the executable files), 
(b) the edited datasets (irisENN.csv and letter-recognitionENN.csv), and, 
(c) the reduced datasets (irisIB2.csv and letter-recognitionIB2.csv).
